# Friday Finance - Live Coding

This is a sample project to support _Live Coding Sessions_ for selection of candidates to ingress [Friday Finance](https://www.fridayfinance.com/), created inside [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) to facilitate live online execution by the candidate, but it's also executable locally in any environment with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Tecnologies

This sample project is structured with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/), a framework on top of the [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) progressive framework. As its base, it also leverages [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle and serve with hot-reload, including [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) to serve a simulated JavaScript server at `/api` URL. The interface is fundamentally a set of Vue components, built with HTML, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Setup and Running

StackBlitz automatically runs and start the live preview at a [live preview URL](https://fridayfinancelivecoding-ilpf--3000.local-credentialless.webcontainer.io/).

To run it locally, make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# or npm
npm install
```

Afterwards, just run the development server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
# yarn
yarn dev

# or npm
npm run dev
```

Check out the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/) for more information on how everything works.

## Routes and Endpoints

The frontend routes (generated by files inside `/pages` folder) are:

- `/` - Root page, containing a list of mock transactions which can be textually searched, filtered and sorted by the user.
- `/{id}` - Details page, showing expanded information about a single transaction. The route param `id` is dynamic, passed by through the URL after the click on any transaction of the root page.
- `/_nuxt/assets/sample-layout.svg` - Asset route that shows the `sample-layout.svg` image, which served as a guide for this project layout creation.

The backend endpoints (generated by files inside `/server/api` folder) are:

- `/api/categories` - Returns a list of categories (the flattened version of the hierarchy of mocked categories found in the `/server/mock/categories.ts` file).
- `/api/transaction?id={id}` - Returns a single transaction object, if found, based on the query `id` param.
- `/api/transactions?skip={skip}&size={size}&search={search}&status={status}&billStatus={billStatus}&sort={sort}` - Returns a list of transactions (mocked data randomically generated by using [fakerjs](https://fakerjs.dev/) library, based on the logic found in the `/server/mock/transactions.ts` file), which can be optionally paginated (depending on the existence of `skip` and `size` query params), textually searched (depending on the existence of `search` query param), filtered (depending on the existence of `status` and `billStatus` query params), and sorted (depending on the existence of `sort` query param).

Worth to observe that not all the descriptions above are working right now, exactly because part of the functionalities are meant to be completed by the candidate during the interview process.

## Questions

The questions are the following:

- **Question 1:** _"Spot the difference"_, the game. Find up to 7 layout inconsistencies.
  - _Files:_ [sample-layout.svg](https://images2.imgbox.com/ec/5f/KxozVbz7_o.png) and `/pages/index.vue`.
- **Question 2:** Filter transactions by `query.billStatus`, if provided.
  - _File:_ `/server/api/transactions.get.ts`.
  - _Optional, if Question 3 is solved instead._
- **Question 3:** Sort the transactions, depending on having `query.sort` or not.
  - _File:_ `/server/api/transactions.get.ts`.
  - _Optional, if Question 2 is solved instead._
- **Question 4:** Allow infinite scrolling pagination, based on `query.skip` and `query.size`.
  - _File:_ `/server/api/transactions.get.ts`.
- **Question 5:** Get the transaction details by calling the backend endpoint.
  - _File:_ `/pages/[id].vue`.
- **Question 6:** Load data during infinite scrolling using the table's `load-data` event.
  - _File:_ `/pages/index.vue`.
- **Question 7:** Convert the uppercase category names to a title case shape.
  - _File:_ `/server/mock/categories.ts`.
- **Question 8:** Review the `FieldSearch` component code, then suggest possible enhancements.
  - _File:_ `/components/FieldSearch.vue`.
